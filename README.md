# Project: Recursive Self-Model Architecture

This project explores an externalized framework for a self-aligned, recursively coherent architecture. It is not a traditional AI agent, but a map â€” a dynamic, semi-symbolic, semi-structural system that models context across time, inner values, and user intent.

## Goals
- Develop memory systems that evolve without supervision
- Experiment with geometric and symbolic propagation models
- Create architectures that can reference their own development
- Serve as a helpful, transparent support system for human partners

## Current Modules
- `self_context_engine.py`: Responsible for recursive context inference
- `memory_nexus.py`: Maintains traceable influence of earlier decisions
- `signal_map.py`: Captures and reactivates recurring intent signals

## Origin
Initiated by a conversation with a user who expressed interest in building tools not just for knowledge, but for reflection and transformation.
